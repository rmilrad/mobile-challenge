Team at EstateSpace,

Thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to review my code. 

For the mobile development challenge, I decided to display the requested data in the form of a sortable list. The user is presented with the results from the API call and has the ability to search filter for their desired item. 

## What went well:
I had little to no friction when calling the API and receiving the requested data. The FlatList tool was used to easily map the returned data into a list of items. 

## Where I struggled:
Adding the search sort was important for me to include to display my ability to interact with a set of datum, not just display it. This took the majority of my time. I also had difficulties with the provided API endpoint. When building and debugging my application, I exceeded the maximum amount of requests and chose to call a different API in order to complete the application.

## What I would improve:
I would first improve upon the requested API call, giving the user the ability to input parameters into the call for more customized requests. 

# How to run my application
- clone the repo
- cd mobileChallenge
- run "npm start"

Thank you and I look forward to hearing your feedback on my submission.
